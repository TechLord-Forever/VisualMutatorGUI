# VisualMutatorGUI

Simple GUI to visualize a results file from [VisualMutator](https://github.com/pavzaj/visualmutator/releases). The GUI will only show mutations that have the status `Live`.

## Usage

1. Open the VisualMutator dialog `View -> Other Windows -> VisualMutator`.
2. Start a new session and let it finish (this can take a very long time).
3. Click the `Save Results...` button and make sure to include the code (this **will** take a very long time).
4. Start VisualMutatorGUI and load the saved results.
